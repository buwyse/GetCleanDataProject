<h1>README</h1>
<p>Included in this repo is an R script authored in R Studio and a Codebook describing the data, variables, and its transformations. You can download the original data from the link in the codebook to your working directory and then run the included run_analysis.R script to obtain a tidy dataset. For information on the tidy dataset please reference the codebook.</p>
<p>The script is a series of 9 steps which reads the data into R, combines and filters the data, runs a second pass filter, and then tidy's up the dataset providing means of all the measurements by their unique grouping. The final dataset is 11880x4.</p>
